## How This File Grows

1. **At init**: Skeleton only.
2. **During development**: AI suggests saving new checklist items or notes when it detects relevant patterns.
3. **After incidents**: Extract reusable checks from experience (e.g. update-knowledge skill).

### Example

```
Week 1: Init, mostly empty.
Week 2: Add UI checklist items after several UI tasks.
Week 3: Add performance items after an incident.
Week 4: Add data/API items after backend work.
```
